## **Interview Talking Points**

### **Technical Deep-Dive Questions:**

1. **Model Selection Process**: "I implemented 7 different algorithms and used time-series aware cross-validation to compare performance. Random Forest performed best due to its ability to handle the non-linear relationships in cryptocurrency data while being robust to overfitting."

2. **Feature Engineering**: "I created 30+ features including technical indicators like RSI and MACD, rolling statistics, lag features, and price spreads. I used correlation analysis to remove multicollinear features and permutation importance to identify the most predictive signals."

3. **Production Challenges**: "I addressed data quality issues with robust preprocessing, implemented proper train/validation/test splits for time-series data, and created monitoring for model drift detection in the volatile crypto market."

4. **Scale & Performance**: "The system processes hourly data for 8 cryptocurrencies with sub-second prediction times. I optimized performance using vectorized operations with NumPy and parallel processing for hyperparameter tuning."

### **Business Impact Questions:**

1. **Problem Solved**: "Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and difficult to predict. This system provides a systematic, data-driven approach to price forecasting with quantified uncertainty."

2. **Value Delivered**: "The interactive dashboard allows users to compare different models, understand prediction confidence, and make informed decisions based on multiple evaluation metrics."

3. **Future Applications**: "This framework can be extended to other financial instruments, adapted for portfolio optimization, or enhanced with alternative data sources like social media sentiment."
